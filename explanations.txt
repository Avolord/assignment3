# Task 2:
Explanation of Fold-Overs with Chamfer Distance
Chamfer distance handles the mismatch of starting points by comparing points based on proximity rather than order. 
However, since it does not enforce the sequential nature of polygons, it may lead to fold-overs where parts of the polygon overlap incorrectly. 
This occurs because Chamfer distance minimizes the distance to the nearest point without considering the polygon's structural integrity, 
leading to visually incorrect polygons.

# Task 3 b:

The comparison of the losses happens in the main of the utility.py (at the bottom)
